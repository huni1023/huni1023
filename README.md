### 👋

I'm a researcher and a founder fueled by curiosity and a passion for enhancing human learning.<br/>
I hold a B.S. in Physics Education and an M.A. in Lifelong Education (Human Resource Development). <br/>
My research interests include Data Mining, Measurement, Knowledge Tracing, Natural Language Processing, Causality, Intelligent Tutoring Systems, and Item Response Theory. <br/>
Practically, I build systems to evaluate learners' abilities and create useful tools, such as websites and web applications. <br/>
In 2025, I built my own research company named [MooWee Lab](https://moowee-lab.com/), collaborating with many enthusiastic partners.
